# Calcium
Getting bored of Hindi speakers? People hate your rules about an English-only server? Here's the solution! Calcium is a Paper plugin that translates any message into English and automatically punishes users based on their violations. This plugin is best used on Minecraft servers that strictly enforce "English-only" environment by ensuring that all communications are understandable and adhere to established rules. By translating messages in real-time, it makes chat moderation and censoring ways easier than before.

In addition to its translation capabilities, Calcium monitors chat for how many time an user chat in other language than in English. When a violation is detected, the plugin gives the player a "score", which can range from warnings and temporary mutes to kicks and bans, depending on how high the "score" is. This automated enforcement helps maintain order and ensures that all players follow the server's guidelines. (You can turn it off as well...!)

Calcium also offers a high degree of customization, allowing server administrators to define specific rules and corresponding punishments to suit their community's needs. Detailed reports on user behavior and violations are generated, aiding administrators in tracking problematic players and making informed decisions. The plugin is designed to integrate smoothly with other Paper plugins, making it a versatile and valuable addition to any Minecraft server setup.

# WORK IN PROGRESS
It might not be here, but i'll try to finish all the TODO's then release once ready. This is actively tested on my private server, though you do not have access to it (because i need to be >13 to use socializing platforms like Discord and etc).
